# Note-Taker (https://ariehh1-note-taker.herokuapp.com/)

In this repository, I have created a note-taker application that allows the user to input, save, and delete a note. The note must contain a title and text in order for the note to be saved. To write a new note, simply click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the application.

When a new note is created, it will generate on the far left pane of the application. To see what was written in previous notes, simply click on the note itself. Lastly, to delete a specific note within the application, click the red garbage can icon. When the user clicks on the "Note Taker" text in the upper left corner of the application, it will take them to the "Get Started" home page.

<h1>User Story:</h1>
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

<h1>Business Context:</h1>
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

<h1>Setup:</h1>
1) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"
2) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the server: "npm run watch"
3) Once this command is run, a successful server message will appear "App listening on PORT: 8080"
4) To access the deployed application, type "localhost:8080" in the url web address bar

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue developing the application, I would add in more note functionality around duplication and finding specific note items. When a user wants to search for a specific note item, a "find" bar would appear at the top of the application. To eliminate duplication upon user entry, a prompt message could appear alerting the user that a similar note entry has been created and where that note appears within the application.
