# Note-Taker

In this repository, I have created a note-taker application that allows the user to input, save, and delete a note. The note must contain a title and text in order for the note to be saved. To write a new note, simply click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the application.

When a new note is created, it will generate on the far left pane of the application. To see what was written in previous notes, simply click on the note itself. Lastly, to delete a specific note within the application, click the red garbage can icon. When the user clicks on the "Note Taker" text in the upper left corner of the application, it will take them to the "Get Started" home page.

<h1>Setup:</h1>
In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the server: "npm run watch". Once this comman is run, a successful server message will appear "App listening on PORT: 8080". To access the application, type "localhost:8080" in the url web address bar.
